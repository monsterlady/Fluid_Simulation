# Basic Fluid Simulation

This project is a basic implementation of fluid simulation in Unity, following the instructional video available on YouTube. The simulation uses a custom framework and shaders provided in the tutorial to create realistic fluid dynamics within the Unity engine.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- Unity Editor (2022.3.8f1)
- Rider

This project has been developed and tested on the Unity Editor. Compatibility with other engines or versions is not guaranteed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open the project** in Unity by selecting `Open` in the Unity Hub and navigating to the project folder.
3. **Load the main scene** to start exploring the fluid simulation.

## Features

- **Particle-Based Fluid Simulation**: Utilizes a particle system to simulate fluid behavior and dynamics.
- **Custom Shaders**: Leverages shaders provided in the tutorial for rendering and calculations.
- **Interactive Environment**: Allows interaction with the fluid through input methods defined in the project.

## How to Use

- **Play the Scene**: Hit the play button in Unity to start the simulation.
- **Interact with Fluid**: Follow the control instructions provided in the tutorial video to interact with the fluid.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Experiment with different parameters in the `ParticleSpawner` script and shaders to customize the simulation.
